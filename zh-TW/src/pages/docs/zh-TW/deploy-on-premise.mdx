# <Heading hidden>Deploy on-premise</Heading>

Self-hosting ILLA means hosting and managing the ILLA platform on your own server or machine instead of using a third-party service provider. This approach is often considered more secure and private, as you have complete control over your data and its use.

ILLA will offer a cloud-hosted version and the option to set up your instance on various platforms soon.

## Self-hosted

Self-hosting ILLA on your own infrastructure allows you to integrate it seamlessly with your existing setup without the need to maintain a separate configuration. This enables you to use the features and capabilities of your existing infrastructure and extend them to ILLA. Some advantages of deploying ILLA on your infrastructure include:

### Security

By hosting ILLA on your own infrastructure, you can keep your data on-premises and ensure that your API keys or security credentials never leave your server. This allows you to apply the same security rules to ILLA that you apply to any other app on your server. The applications you build using ILLA will be hosted on your infrastructure and inside your corporate networks. You can also choose to host ILLA on internal networks behind a firewall, and configure it to work with your custom domain and security policies.

### Internal database

By self-hosting ILLA, you can connect to a database running on the same machine or intranet and use it to build apps. ILLA uses MongoDB to store app data and Redis to store session information and non-critical caches. If you want to integrate ILLA with custom MongoDB or Redis servers hosted on your infrastructure, you will need to modify the configuration of environment variables and point them to your custom MongoDB/Redis instances.

### Updates

By self-hosting ILLA, you can configure more flexible update schedules and other maintenance activities. You can follow the steps provided to set up a maintenance window and schedule automatic updates. This allows you to maintain and update your ILLA instance in a way that is convenient for you and your organization.
