## <Heading hidden>API authentication</Heading>

ILLA can support almost any kind of authentication. We have partnered with various companies to support all standard types of authentication and have also developed methods to support any custom authentication methods we do not natively support.

You can use static authentication tokens or create an authentication system that prompts the end user for their credentials each time they access the application.

This page will provide you with instructions on how to authenticate your API. If you have questions or need help, you can contact our support team using the Intercom bubble on this page or the help icon inside the editor.
