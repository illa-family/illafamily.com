### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to control the image display with a button.

#### Step 1 Add Components

Add a **`Image`** component and a **`button`** component to the canvas.

You can set the `image source` of image component to any image address you want to display. Here we will use the default image as a start example and label the button as "Change" as shown below

#### Step 2 Configure the component

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to set the image source of the **`image`** component to a new image address.

1.  Click the `**button**` component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`image1`** component that you want to change as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`setImageUrl`** action
4.  Put the new image address in the **`Value`** field
