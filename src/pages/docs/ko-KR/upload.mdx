### 방법

You can use other components to control the Upload component. We support the following three methods:

| clearValidation | Used to clear the validation message                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| clearValue      | Used to clear the selected                              |
| setDisabled     | Used to set the upload component to disabled or enabled |

### 이벤트 핸들러

To trigger actions when the selected files change

### Data of Uploader

The upload component has some commonly used data, which can be called in the app.

`value` an array consisting of the base64 data of files. 

`files` an array of objects. The keys of the objects include `lastModified`, `name`, `size`, `type`. You can use  `{{upload1.files.map(file =>file.name)}}` to get an array of file names and you can also get lastModified array, size array, type array in the same way. 

### Upload files to a cloud storage service

Upload an image and display it on the image component
Change the image source to the file base64 data of upload component. The base64 data is stored in the value attribute in array. And we should splice the file prefix with the file data. The code is as follows. 

```jsx
{{'data:image/jpeg;base64,'+upload1.value[0]}}
```
