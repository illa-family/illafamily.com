## <h2 hidden>What is Cascader?</h2>

A cascader is a type of input component that allows users to select hierarchical data, such as a category or subcategory from a dropdown menu. When a user selects an option from the dropdown menu, the cascader will automatically update to show the relevant subcategories or options in a nested dropdown menu.

For example, if you have a cascader input component for selecting a product category, the first dropdown menu may show all the available categories, such as "Electronics," "Clothing," and "Books." When a user selects "Electronics," the cascader will update to show the subcategories of electronics, such as "Phones," "Laptops," and "Tablets." This allows users to quickly and easily navigate through hierarchical data and select the option they need.

### Methods

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following two methods:

-   **setValue**

To set the selected option, for example, {{”value1”}}

| 속성    | 설명          |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Value | Input value |

-   **clearValue**

To clear the value of the selected component 

Example Usage:

Cascader component support listening to the `onChange` event of other components using built-in event system. Set it up by following these example steps:

1.  Add an event trigger to the component that you want to listen to. For example, if you want to listen to the **`onChange`** event of a Radio Group component, you would add an event trigger to that Radio Group component.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, select the **`Cascader`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`SetValue`** action and select the appropriate value for the Cascader component. This will be the value that the Cascader component have and will update when the event is triggered.
4.  Save the event trigger settings and repeat the process for any other components that you want to listen to.

Once you've set up the event triggers, the Cascader input component will automatically update whenever the **`onChange`** event is triggered on the other components. This allows you to create dynamic interfaces that respond to user input in real-time, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with your application.

### 응답 데이터

The component has some commonly used data, which can be called via **`{{componentName.propertyName}}`** in the app.

| Property name  | 설명                                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| dataSourceMode | the mode of the data source in cascader (default dynamic) |
| displayName    | the name of this component (ie cascader1)                 |
| expandTrigger  | trigger events (click)                                    |
| value          | Selected value                                            |
| label          | label value                                               |
| labelAlign     | alignment of cascader label (left or right)               |
| labelPosition  | position of cascader label (left or right)                |
| labelWidth     | the integer representing width of label                   |
| placeholder    | placeholder value                                         |

Example: {{cascader1.value[0]}

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to map the data from the data source to options in cascader dynamically. 

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in Supabase called **`project`,** as well as a subtable called **`therapist`** which are aligned by **`project_id`**.

Then we can create a new action for Supabase from the action list, listing all data in project and named supabasedb1 

```sql
SELECT [project.id](http://project.id/) as project_id, [therapist.name](http://therapist.name/) as therapist_name from therapist join project on therapist.project_id = [project.id](http://project.id/)
```

#### Step 2 Transform the data

Next, we can **`enable`** the **`transformer`** section under the Select Section. Within the text area, we can capture only the values and labels we need from the data and transform them into cascader-friendly options using JavaScript.

```jsx
const transformedArray = data.reduce((acc, current) => {
  const existing = acc.find((item) => item.value === current.project_id);
  if (existing) {
    const therapist = { value: current.therapist_id, label: current.therapist_name };
    existing.children.push(therapist);
  } else {
    const project = { value: current.project_id, label: current.project_name, children: [] };
    const therapist = { value: current.therapist_id, label: current.therapist_name };
    project.children.push(therapist);
    acc.push(project);
  }
  return acc;
}, []);

return transformedArray;
```

The final action should be displayed the same as

![cascader 1](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/cascader1.png)

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

#### Step 3 Configure the component

After dragging a cascader component to the canvas, we can single click to configure its data source to `{{supabasedb1.data}}` 

Optional: Here we set a default value of `{{['a', '1']}}` for corresponding `{{['Psychotherapy'], ['James']}}` labels.
