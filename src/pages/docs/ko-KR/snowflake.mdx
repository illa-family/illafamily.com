## <h2 hidden>What is Snowflake?</h2>

In Illa, you can use the Snowflake query editor to execute SQL queries against your Snowflake data warehouse. You can connect to Snowflake by entering your Snowflake account credentials, including the account name, username, password, and warehouse name. Once you have connected to Snowflake, you can use the query editor to write and execute SQL queries to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze your data.

### Create Snowflake

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

-   Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

Select **`Snowflake`** from the database list.

![action_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready Snowflake will display as shown.

-   Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`Snowflake`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to Snowflake database.

### Create Actions

We have created a Snowflake resource, we can add the action by selecting Snowflake from action list and choosing the **`Create action`** button.

![snow_resource_list]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/snow_resource_list.png)

Now we have added the Snowflake server as an action to our building page.
