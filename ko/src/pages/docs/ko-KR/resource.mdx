## <Heading hidden>Resource</Heading>

Connect to your data source and call it in your ILLA Builder. We provide you with adaptable connection modules for different types of data sources. You can build a stable connection between your data and ILLA in a short time, greatly simplifying your data access process.

After successfully creating a resource, you can call it at any app in ILLA. You can also share your resources with your co-developers, improving the efficiency of building apps.

### Supported resources type

ILLA supports a number of major databases, such as MySQL and Postage, as well as APIs such as the Rest API and GraphQL.
